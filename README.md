Created an embedded computer using the ATMega32 microcontroller. 

- Wrote a C program that is able to play the notes that are stored in memory.
- The input is the keypad, each button represented a different note.
- The output is a speaker which plays the notes as the button is pressed.
- The LCD protrays the frequency and duration of each note, which could be altered using the keypad.
